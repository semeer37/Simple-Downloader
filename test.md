Sure! Here is an example of how you can do this in Python using the `requests` library for HTTP requests along with asyncio and diskcache libraries (to cache 
downloaded files) if required. 

Please note that downloading large amounts of media data synchronously could be complex due to reasons such as network congestion, server issues etc., which you might 
not want/need in all cases depending on your use-case scenario. This is mainly for educational purposes and understanding how asyncio works under the hood or if it's 
necessary at a later point of time given certain constraints (like downloading media files with specific URL).
```python
import requests  # to handle http request, you need this library installed in python environment already due some packages are pre-installed. If not then use pip 
install package_name command on your terminal or cmd for windows/linux respectively before running the code again.. like 'pip3 install requests' if its Python2 based 
(i am assuming here).
import asyncio  # to handle asynchronous tasks in python, we will make network calls and process them later using a library called AsyncIO. You need this installed by 
default with all versions of pyhton but it is not pre-installed on packages like requests or other libraries so you'll have pip install if required
from diskcache import Cache  # to cache downloaded files, we will use DiskCache python package which stores the results in a directory asynchronously. It works by 
caching your result of an expensive function call and saving it for future calls with same arguments (i.e., you can save previous work). You need this installed via 
pip install diskcache
import os  # to get current working dir, we will use them later on in our program.. like 'os' package is provided by python itself that provides methods specifically 
related the directory operations such as getting path of executable file etc. which are required for other packages or functions used here (like urllib and requests).
import aiohttp  # to handle http request, async programming flow control with libraries/features like coroutines in Python similar concepts would be present inside 
these Libraries too.. we will use this library as it simplifies working on web servers & handling HTTP client sessions. You need 'pip install aiohttp' command line 
tool installed for python2 based environments (you can check your version using sys.version_info).
async def download(url, session):  # define async function to handle downloading task.. the requests is made inside this and then processed in main() method which 
will start our event loop automatically after defining it here before we run code execution starts from where they are defined (in aiohttp only) or when these lines 
of codes get executed.
    try:  # handling any exception that could occur while downloading.. for example if server not found at the time http request is made, this will be handled as 
below... We can write some logic inside it and provide error message on console (optional). I have used Try/Except Block to catch all possible exceptions.
        async with session.get(url) as response:  # make a get HTTP requests.. we are using 'async' keyword here for handling the coroutine object, similar concept is 
present in Python also under normal request library ie `requests` module which makes http calls etc., and then handle it after getting result back to us.
            filename = url.split("/")[-1]  # get file name from URL (it should be last part of the path).. This will make sure that we are downloading correct media 
data by providing proper 'filename' according with your requirement, e.g., 
some_file-20893dfc7aac4db5b9f6febb1dbfeabedeaebbaaebebddeffecddfdccfcfaaaafdcadecaaccacecaefcd...
            dirname = os.path.dirname(filename)  # get current directory path to save file.. similar concept as above but getting the 'directory' part of URL which 
will be used for saving and caching files here, like '/home/user1234567890...'.
            if not os.path.exists(dirname):  # check whether this directory exists or not.. If it doesnt then create one (only need to do once at the time of 
initialization) because we don't want any exceptions when trying save media data in none existing directories, hence condition will be true
                cache = Cache('.cache')   # instantiate our DiskCache object here by calling constructor with '.'. This creates a new directory for saving files under 
current working dir. We can say it works as disk_cache's backend store all of results into specified folder in hard drive where Python interpreter is running from 
this point onward, which also supports using filesystem (file-based storage) and other backing stores that provide file system like I/O access to a remote server or 
database.
                cache[dirname] = await response.content()  # store the content downloaded in our previously defined async function into diskcache directory.. So now 
every time we download same url again from this location, it'll fetch old data (saved before), if not exist then save new one and return with previous saved file so 
that next request will get older files.
            else:  # here means the filename already exists in our cache directories previously downloaded earlier.. So just simply load up its content into memory 
without downloading again from server because it'll be faster as we have loaded data which was fetched before during last time (in case of media file), and not 
re-downloading multiple times.
                response_content = await(cache[filename])  # get saved downloaded files in previous session.. If filename exists then load those previously cached 
contents, else download from the server again but save it for later usage... Similar concept as we already have done above with asyncio and requests library used here 
under normal request module.
            return response_content   # Return content of media file once all processing is complete (data has been downloaded).. This will be returned back to us by 
main() method after fetching the data from server in a form suitable for reading it, like writing into .mp3 or any other format if required... 
    except Exception as e:   # catch and handle exceptions that could occur during downloading. It can help identify error sources (file not found etc.) on console.. 
The 'except' block is used to execute the code when an exception occurs in Python, which we have declared above with async def download() function call inside it...
        print(f"Error occurred while fetching data from URL: {url}. Error details are as follows :{str(e)}")  # Prints error message on console if any exceptions 
occur. You can customize this part to do whatever you want.. e is an instance of Exception class which holds information about the exception that has been thrown
        return None   # Return none in case of errors, so it helps us when caller decide what will be done with these failed data (or error).  Asyncio or request 
library can provide different ways to handle such cases. For example requests could throw and catch specific exceptions like `requests.exceptions.RequestException` 
etc., but async IO does not have direct equivalent, instead it uses call_soon method of Task class in Python which you may use for tasks that should be done when the 
current task is ready or available (usually HTTP request).
async def main():   # This function contains our event loop.. similar to a normal python program. It includes all other functions we defined above and will make 
network calls asynchronously using asyncio library, so they can run concurrently due Python's Global Interpreter Lock(GIL) which allows multi-core CPU support in 
parallelism (i hope this explains it).
    urls = [...]   # List of URLS you want to download.. Replace with actual data here. e.g., https://example1234567890/path_to... etc.  It's a list, similar concept 
as Python tuples and lists but for different use-cases like storing multiple urls in there or iterating over it using loop (i hope this explains).
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:   # Create an instance of HTTP client sessions.. This is necessary to keep track on the cookies, headers etc., if 
any when we make request by requests module from Python's standard library due some server respond differently based upon header and data passed along (i hope this 
explains).
        tasks = [download(url, session) for url in urls]   # Create list of asynchronous calls to download all URLS one after the other. We are using asyncio here 
because it allows us create an infinite number concurrent task while waiting on each request finish or error occurs (i hope this explains).
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # Wait for tasks completion and then proceed with next, similar concept as requests module's `wait()` method is available which 
waits until all of the futures are done but here it will wait on an iterable collection/generator like above list instead (i hope this explains).
if __name__ == "__main__":   # Check if script running directly or imported as a module. In case we run our main function in python interpreter then below lines of 
code execute otherwise, execution moves to next line and so on..  You can see similar concept here with checking the source file is being run directly from 
terminal/command-line etc., but different for importing this script into another Python program (imported as a module).
    asyncio.run(main())   # Run our main function until completion, same concepts are available in case of requests library's `request()` method or similar when we 
run python interpreter from terminal/command-line etc.. For more details about these methods you may refer to official Python docs on this topic (i hope this 
explains).
